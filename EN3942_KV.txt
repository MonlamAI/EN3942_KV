Vajra Verses of Aspiration for the Nine Vehicles Namo gurubhyaḥ! The Victor's Dharma teachings of discipline for followers Progress in the manner of successive vehicles According to nine stages of individual capacity- May we practice these without confusion to their full perfection! With the vehicle of listeners, one studies the four truths to accept and avoid; With the vehicle of pratyekabuddhas, one reflects on engagement and reversal of dependent arising; With the vehicle of bodhisattvas, one meditates on the indivisible two truths. May our consciousness be purified through these causal vehicles! With the Kriyā Vehicle, one realizes the view beyond limits; With the Ubhaya Vehicle, one meditates on outer and inner equality; With the Yoga Vehicle, one enacts the deeds of a buddha. May our minds mature as awareness through these vehicles of ascetic practice! The Mahā Vehicle is the ground tantra, ripening as the divine body; The Anu Vehicle is the path tantra, the completion of bliss and emptiness; The Ati Vehicle is the resultant tantra, maturing as timeless awareness. May our minds be liberated through these skillful vehicles of powerful transformation! In summary, deeply cultivating bodhi mind and the resolution to be free, Receiving in one's heart the blessings of a supreme deity, With all sights and sounds as the three maṇḍalas of awareness, May all beings simultaneously reach the level of enlightenment! Youthful Abhaya ("Fearless One") wrote this at the age of fourteen in a playful spirit in the presence of Mogtön, the great holder of the secret, who laughed, "You should call this composition of yours Vajra Verses of Aspiration for the Nine Vehicles." Auspiciousness!
